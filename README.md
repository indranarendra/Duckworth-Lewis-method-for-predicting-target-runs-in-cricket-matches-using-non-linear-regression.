# Duckworth-Lewis-method-for-predicting-target-runs-in-cricket-matches-using-non-linear-regression.
1) Extract four important features(Innings, Runs Remaining, Overs Remaining, Wickets in Hand) from the given csv file.
2) Take all the data points of first innings and define the loss function as sum of squared errors loss function, summed across overs and wickets.
